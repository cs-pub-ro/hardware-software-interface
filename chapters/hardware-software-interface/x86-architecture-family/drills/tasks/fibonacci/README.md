# Fibonacci

You will solve this exercise starting from the `fibonacci.asm` file located in the `drills/tasks/fibonacci` directory.

Calculate the Nth Fibonacci number, where N is given through the `eax` register.

>**NOTE**: The fibonacci series goes as follows : `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ...` where each element `f[i] = f[i-2] + f[i-1]`, except for the first two elements.
>
>**TIP**: For example, if the value stored in `eax` is equal to `5`, a correct solution will display `3` and for `7`, it will display `8`.
