# Grumpy Jumps

You will solve the exercises starting from the `grumpy_jumps.asm` file located in the `drills/tasks/grumpy-jumps` directory.

1. Modify the values of the `eax` and `ebx` registers so that when the program is run, the message `Well done!` is displayed.
Follow the `TODO` comments.

1. Why does the wrong message still appear?
Modify the source so that the wrong message is not displayed anymore.

> **TIP**: To determine the necessary values for the `eax` and `ebx` registers, we recommend using GDB.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../../reading/README.md) reading material.
