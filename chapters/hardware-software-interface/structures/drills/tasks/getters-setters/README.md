# Getter-Setter

Write in the `getter_setter_printf.asm` file the instructions needed to display the values of the `int_x`, `char_y`, and `string_s` fields from the `sample_obj` object.

The program's output after a correct solution should be:

```Assembly
int_x: 1000
char_y: a
string_s: My string is better than yours
```

Next, overwrite the values of the `int_x`, `char_y`, `string_s` fields in the `sample_obj` object with the values from the `new_int`, `new_char`, and `new_string` variables.

Validate the results using the display sequence written earlier. After a correct solution, the program's output is:

```Assembly
int_x: 2000
char_y: b
string_s: Are you sure?
```
