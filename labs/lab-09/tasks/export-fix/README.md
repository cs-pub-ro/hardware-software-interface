# Task: Repair Export Problems

Navigate to `tasks/export-fix/support/`.

Each subdirectory (i.e., `support/a-func/`, `suppoer/b-var/`, `support/c-var-2/`)
contains a problem related to exporting some symbols (functions or variables).

In each subdirectory, run the `make` command, identify the problem and edit the
files needed to fix the problem.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through
[this relevant section](../../reading/calling-convention.md) of the reading
material.
