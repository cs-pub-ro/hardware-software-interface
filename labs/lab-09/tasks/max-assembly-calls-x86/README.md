# Task: Maximum Calculation in C with Call from Assembly (32-bit version)

This is the exact same task as the last, with one major difference.
We are going to solve this using 32-bit assembly instead of 64-bit.
Take note of the distinctions.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through
[this relevant section](../../reading/calling-convention.md) of the reading
material.
