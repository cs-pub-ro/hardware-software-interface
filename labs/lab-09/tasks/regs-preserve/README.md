# Task: Keeping Records

Navigate to `tasks/regs-preserve/support` and open `main.asm`. Here, you will
find the  `print_reverse_array()` function that loops over the elements of an
array and calls `printf()` for each one.

Analyze the code in `main.asm`, then compile and run the program.

What happened? The program runs indefinitely. That's because the `printf()`
function does not preserve the value in the `RCX` register, used here as a
counter.

Uncomment the lines marked `TODO1` and rerun the program.

## Troubleshooting 

Uncomment the lines marked `TODO2` in the assembly file from the previous
exercise. The code sequence makes a call to the `double_array()` function,
implemented in C, just before displaying the vector using the function seen
earlier. The `double_array()` function should double each element of the
original array.

Compile and run the program. Is the output as expected? Do you get a SEGFAULT?
Investigate with GDB and take note of the Parameter Registers at the time of
each function call. One you find the problem, fix it.

> **NOTE:** We compiled double_array.c with -O2 optimization level to increase
            the probability of RDI and RSI registers being used in calculations.
            With -O0, the generated assembly code is much simpler and the
            parameter registers are most likely never used for anything other
            than holding the function argument values. In this case, the bug in
            main.asm could pass unnoticed, but the implementation would still
            be incorrect.
