# Labs

They are meant to be used by teachers, trainers, students and hobbyists who want to learn about the Assembly language, pointers, and memory security.

Each lab has its own folder.
Content for each lab covers a specific topic.
Each topic is further split into different kinds of materials that refer to it.
These may be any collection of the following:

- `reading/`: content to be assimilated by learners on their own
- `tasks/`: practical exercises for learners
- `media/`: images, videos, audio or auxiliary materials to be imported in text content
- `guides/`: tutorials for learners with guided steps towards the solution
